# Chess Engine Competition
Welcome to the UWCS x Chess Soc x Optiver Chess Engine Competition 2026!

This project will allow you to make your own custom chess engine by implementing your own evaluation function. All participants are required to use the base chess engine implementation found in this repo. This ensures that all competitors code will run and reduce the range of concepts you need to worry about.

## Competition details
The competition will run in 2 parts. The first part is development. This is when you will be implementing your evaluation functions and will run from W1 Monday - W4 Sunday. Submissions will be open during the last week of development. These submissions will be judged based on technical prowess and how creative the solution is. From these submissions, 5 will be selected to enter the next part of the competition where the chess engines will be pitted against chess players from Chess Soc on W5 Thursday! The chess engines will then by judged by Chess Soc based on playing style and general performance against real opponents.
